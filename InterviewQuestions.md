1 - Tell me about yourself.

I'm a servant leader, and I live, to serve my team at home and at the office.  I'm a first generation American, any my parents immigrated here before I was born to provide a better life for our family.  I have the "immigrant" work ethic, and I don't shy away from hard tasks especially those that would support/help my family/team.  I've worked at a range of jobs, from delis, to retail, to software and now management, but the one thing that ties them all is I love to serve.

I love engineering, as it all comes down to problem solving and understanding the tradeoffs for any solution while understanding there is no "perfect" solution.  I also love working with people and helping them be their healthiest selves so they can grow into whatever role they want to achieve.

While my current has been fulfilling and has allowed me to grow, I would like to find a new opportunity to make an impact and fulfilling a new mission.

2 - What is your greatest strength?

I am a consensus builder that also takes action to gather enough evidence to get to consensus quickly.
