### [LinkedIn Common Questions](https://www.linkedin.com/interview-prep/assessments/urn:li:fs_assessment:(1,a)/question/urn:li:fs_assessmentQuestion:(10011,aq11)/)

1 - Tell me about yourself.

I'm a servant leader, and I work to serve my team by putting them first.  My goal as a manager for my team is to find the path to growth for each team member and understand what it is that makes them feel engaged, listened to, and growing toward their particular goals.  I regularly check in on my team members' health, both physical and mental, while making sure we "know" one another so we can better interact with one another.  I also love engineering, as it all comes down to problem-solving and understanding the tradeoffs for any solution while understanding there is no "perfect" solution.  

While my current has been fulfilling and has allowed me to grow, I would like to find a new opportunity to make an impact and fulfilling a new mission.

2 - What is your greatest strength?

I am a consensus builder that also takes action to gather enough evidence to get to a consensus quickly.  I continually grow a network of peers within the company that I can lean on when I need help or feedback.  They can be peers within IT or peers on the business side, I am able to move between the two due to my interpersonal skills but also the domain knowledge I've built up over the years.  

Due to these connections, I can determine how best to build consensus on items or projects that my team is involved in.  Understanding who can best answer a question or provide guidance, allows for my team to be able to prioritize work faster and execute cleanly.

3 - What is your greatest weakness?

I love to serve and in some cases, I try to take on more than I should from my team.  When I take on too much, I am unable to properly disengage from the day-to-day to assess the team's progress on strategic initiatives either at the project/product level or at the team level.  

As such, I've become more conscious about making sure I delegate more to my team and in some cases, pair with them to level up their knowledge in a particular area to prepare them to take on more at a later time.
